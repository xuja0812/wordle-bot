    The wordlist class is a wrapper for a list of words.
    It is not literally a list, though it has some list like features (see the __dunder__ methods)

    Importantly it provides three key facilities.
    For a given wordlist `words` you can
    - get a random word in the word list by writing words.get_random_word()
    - statefully remove the words inconsistent with the `info` you received from a guess
      by writing `words.refine(info)`
    - return a new literal list of words corresponding to a `pattern` and a `guess` by writing
      `words.matching(pattern, guess)`
